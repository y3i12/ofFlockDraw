# ofxFlockDraw

Image processing app (screen-saver-a-like) that draws images using particle flocks. Coded in C++ using OpernFrameworks.

Originally I created this project with libCinder (available here-> https://github.com/y3i12/FlockDraw ) and now it was time to try something new and port it to another lib.
